# nwg-shell Hyprland config file
#
# The nwg-shell-config utility generates a part of settings for you:
# General, Input devices, Touchpad, Dwindle layout, Master layout.
# Decoration, animations, gestures and per-device config are left to be configured by yourself.
# Refer to the Hyprland wiki at https://wiki.hyprland.org for more information.

#
# Monitors & workspaces: nwg-displays generates 2 files, which we include here:
#
source = ~/.config/hypr/monitors.conf
source = ~/.config/hypr/workspaces.conf

#
# Autostart. Feel free to add your own entries.
# Shell components will be started in the includes.conf file, which we include below.
#
exec = /usr/lib/polkit-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
exec-once = ~/.azotebg-hyprland # Wallpaper
exec-once = systemctl --user import-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
exec-once = dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP

#
# Include settings generated by nwg-shell-config
#
source = ~/.config/hypr/includes.conf

#
# All the settings below are up to you. We don't touch them in the shell config utility.
